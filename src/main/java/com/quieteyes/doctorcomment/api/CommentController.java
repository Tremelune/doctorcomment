  /**
   * I sometimes like to keep request/response structures distinct from the structure of models, because tying the
   * structure of your API to the structure of your persistent data is follyâ€”it complicates changes to an extreme
   * degree. As such, wrapper/adapter requests can be handy, and puts the expected structure of the request right where
   * you're usually looking for it. The downside is manual translation of values.
   *
   * It's worth noting that this need not be done until an API must change, and it's possible that it might be moot
   * depending on the API versioning strategy. It's also worth noting that this probably is never worth it for internal
   * APIs used by other services, as opposed to the Public At Large (who will burn you on Twitter for breaking an
   * endpoint that was deprecated six years ago).
